Codember is a game with programming challenges and investigation.
To solve the challenges, you could use any programming language.
```

This repository contains my solutions for the Codember event hosted by [Midudev](https://midu.dev/)
in 2023. All implementations are written in Rust.

I've utilized Rust to practice and enhance my skills in the language.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or share insights about Rust
that I may not be aware of!

## How to Run the Challenges

To run the challenges and see the solutions, use the following commands:

1. First, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine.

   ```bash
     cargo version
   ```

   [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust if you don't already
   have it.

1. Run the code and tests.

   ```bash
   # Execute the code inside `challenge_xx.rs` files and print the solutions
   cargo run

   # Run all tests
   cargo test
   ```

## Folder Structure

[Here](./src/CHALLENGES.md) you can see instructions to solve the challenges.

```bash
